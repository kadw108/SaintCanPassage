A small mod for Rain World 1.9 that allows Saint to use passages. For all the lazy players out there.

If you don't have Rain World through Steam, you can still install this mod by clicking the green Code button, then Download ZIP. Move SaintCanPassage_final into your Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods folder.
